Repository for attempts at the advent of code challenge (https://adventofcode.com)

### Introduction
- The Advent of Code is a yearly challenge that starts on December 1st and goes until December 25th.
- The goal is to solve festive-themed coding exercises/puzzles that get progressively more difficult per day.
- I started working on Advent of Code in 2021, but lost a few days due to illness and could not recover lost ground.
- I also did not make it very far in 2022 due to work obligations.
- 2023 is a bit different as I'm attempting it in 2024 without the normal "once per day" time constraint.
